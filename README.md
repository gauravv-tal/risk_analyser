## Getting Started

1. **Choose your dashboard**:

   - **New Dashboard** (Recommended): Modern React with Tailwind CSS
   - **Existing Dashboard**: Material-UI based implementation

2. **Set up the backend API**:
   The dashboards expect a single endpoint for PR analysis:

   ```
   POST /api/pr/analyze
   Body: { "prUrl": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123" }
   ```

3. **Run the frontend**:

   ```bash
   # For new dashboard
   cd dashboard && npm run dev

   # For existing dashboard
   cd "Impact & Risk Dashboard" && npm start
   ```

## API Integration

Both dashboards are designed to work with a single AI-powered API endpoint that provides:

- Pull Request metadata extraction
- Risk scoring and analysis
- Impacted modules identification
- AI-generated test recommendations
- Code complexity analysis
- Historical risk data

See `dashboard/src/data/sampleData.ts` for the expected API response format.
